              <p>
                VietinBank was born into the tradition of centralized ETL FinServ architectures. To date, the monolith architecture had worked well for VietinBank ‚Äî it enabled the developer autonomy and flexibility that carried them through their hypergrowth phases. After 8 years, however, VietinBank's sheer volume of customer growth, as well as geographic and product expansion beyond their original banking business, led to an entangled, behemoth ETL with countless cross-dependencies and no clear path to continuing to scale.
              </p>
              <p>
                For VietinBank engineers, business critical data transformations started taking increasingly long to run, with chains of dependencies as deep as 70 and insufficient formal agreements on who was responsible for maintaining what. As the company continued to grow, it became clear that the ETL would be a primary bottleneck to scale.
              </p>
              
              <div className="bg-slate-800 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg my-8">
                <p className="text-xl italic">
                  VietinBank concluded that there was an urgent need to split up their monolithic ETL repository, amassing over 6 million lines of code, into smaller, more flexible sub-modules.
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                VietinBank's code migration was filled with the monotonous, repetitive work that engineers dread. Moving each data class implementation from one architecture to another while tracing imports correctly, performing multiple delicate refactoring steps, and accounting for any number of edge cases was highly tedious, even to do just once or twice. At VietinBank's scale, however, the total migration scope involved more than 1,000 engineers moving ~100,000 data class implementations over an expected timeline of 18 months.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a world where engineering resources are scarce, such large-scale migrations and modernizations become massively expensive, time-consuming projects that distract from any engineering team's core mission: building better products for customers. Unfortunately, this is the reality for many of the world's largest organizations.

              <p>
                At project outset in 2023, VietinBank had no choice but to rely on their engineers to perform code changes manually. Migrating one data class was a highly discretionary task, with multiple variations, edge cases, and ad hoc decision-making ‚Äî far too complex to be scriptable, but high-volume enough to be a significant manual effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within weeks of HDT AI's launch, VietinBank identified a clear opportunity to accelerate their refactor at a fraction of the engineering hours. Migration or large refactoring tasks are often fantastic projects for HDT AI: after investing a small, fixed cost to teach HDT AI how to approach sub-tasks, HDT AI can go and complete the migration autonomously. A human is kept in the loop just to manage the project and approve HDT AI's changes.

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-12 text-center text-blue-400">The Solution: Custom ETL Migration HDT AI</h2>
            <div className="space-y-8 text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                A task of this magnitude, with the vast number of variations that it had, was a ripe opportunity for fine-tuning. The VietinBank team helped to collect examples of previous migrations their engineers had done manually, some of which were fed to HDT AI for fine-tuning. The rest were used to create a benchmark evaluation set.
              </p>
              <p>
                Against this evaluation set, we observed a <span className="text-blue-400 font-semibold">doubling of HDT AI's task completion scores after fine-tuning, as well as a 4x improvement in task speed. Roughly 40 minutes per sub-task dropped to 10</span>, which made the whole migration start to look much cheaper and less time-consuming, allowing the company to devote more energy to new business and new value creation instead.
              </p>
              <p>
                HDT AI contributed to its own speed improvements by building itself classical tools and scripts it would later use on the most common, mechanical components of the migration. For instance, detecting the country extension of a data class (either 'vn', 'sg', or 'th') based on its file path was a few-step process for each sub-task. HDT AI's script automatically turned this into a single step executable ‚Äî improvements from which added up immensely across all tens of thousands of sub-tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also a compounding advantage on HDT AI's learning. In the first weeks, it was common to see outstanding errors to fix, or small things HDT AI wasn't sure how to solve. But as HDT AI saw more examples and gained familiarity with the task, it started to avoid rabbit holes more often and find faster solutions to previously-seen errors and edge cases. Much like a human engineer, we observed obvious speed and reliability improvements with every day HDT AI worked on the migration.
